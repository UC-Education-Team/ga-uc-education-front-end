# About
The International Aid Hackathon 2022 - hosted by General Assembly for Unlocking Communities, an international non-profit, is seeking a functional software solution to satisfy its expanding educational needs. More about Unlocking Communities.

 “We equip entrepreneurs with the education and tools to sell sustainable products that unlock economic, social, and environmental transformation in their communities.”
 
# Project Brief
Unlocking Communities is looking to provide educational content to their Haitian entrepreneurs within their upcoming Android based app. Core functionality would be to access self-serve training content with individual tracking progress. The ask is to develop an application to deliver a LMS to supplement their current in-person training curriculum.

# User narrative

Without conventional access to the users due to varying constraints - we had to take an adaptive approach towards research to better understand the users. Secondary research was leveraged to paint the landscape and help us empathize and connect with users. Which revealed the following: Within the Western hemisphere, poverty in Haiti is regarded as amongst the most severe. Over two thirds of the country is impoverished, living on just over $2USD average daily. Illiteracy plagues the country of Haiti with an average literacy rate of just over 61%. Infrastructure to provide clean water and food security fails to serve over 28% of its population. With basic human needs not met it leaves immediate improvement to network infrastructure highly unlikely.

# Approach

We understood the non-negotiable blocker to our problem was connectivity. We had alignment from the beginning that functionality was key within the bandwidth constraints, that each feature had to be rendered to its core essence while remaining intuitive. To offset the low literacy rate, we focused on strategic visuals to enhance the user’s experience. Language options provided the needed flexibility to allow for seamless end user engagement. Designs carefully curated to provide maximum value to the hopeful entrepreneur seeking to improve their place in life. All aspects of design and focus had the bandwidth constraints in mind; down to the consideration of only using native system fonts.
# MVP

Light-weight bandwidth demand of app
Intuitive user flows to navigate educational content
Strategic inclusion of relevant visuals to offset illiteracy 
Language button - default [English] alternate [Haitian Creole]
Feedback button to provide user feedback/needs
Sidebar supplementary content to balance content/white space

# STRETCH GOALS

Host deployment of application
Route front-end to back-end modeled data structures
Development of prioritized backlog features - as bandwidth permits
Consideration for downloadable content
